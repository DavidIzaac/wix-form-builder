# Dependencies
I suppose that you already have the latest version of mongodb and nodejs (=> 10.x.x ) in your local computer.
If not, you can download NodeJS in the [official website][officialWebsite] and mongodb at https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/
Note that's important to run 'mongo' on your shell before starting with mongodb in order to connect the shell and the running instance.
If you encounter any problems during the installation, you can contact me at davidgahnassia@gmail.com.

# Installation
1) Clone the repository.
2) Do "npm i" in server and console directories.
3) Do "npm start" in server and console directories.
4) Go to http://localhost:4200 in any web browser that you like.
